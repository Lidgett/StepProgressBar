# StepProgressBar
A Progress Bar with Step Points

Android does not provide a progress bar with step points.  To create one using Views and ViewGroups can be very costly as well as time consuming.
This custom View provides a very stripped down solution by providing one flat View which draws a progress bar and the amount of step points you wish to add directly to the canvas.
